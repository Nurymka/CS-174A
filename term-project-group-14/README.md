### Overview:

We implemented a 2-player "Pong" style game using a top-down three-dimensional model. The advanced features used were collisions, reflections, and shadows. 
The game is retro/futurustic themed, with a current max score running up to 7. 

### Usage:

  1. Player 1 is controlled by using 't' and 'g' keyboard buttons.
  2. Player 2 is controlled by using 'k' and 'm' keyboard buttons.
  3. The game can be paused using the 'p' keyboard button.
  4. The game can be restarted by using the '1' keyboard button. 
  5. Max Score of the game is 7.

### Additional Features:

  1. The Pong Ball changes color depending on its current state. The initial state is yellow, for when the round starts. The moment the ball encounters a paddle, it will change its color to the paddle it just touched. The reflection also changes to reflect this change.

  2. The Game's scoring mechanic involves numbers that are texture mapped onto the gameboard floor. These change depending on which player scores. An additional HTML score icon also flashed everytime a player scores.

  3. There is also a Skybox graphic implemented around the border of the game, which enhances the game graphics and also allows for the title of the game to be displayed.
